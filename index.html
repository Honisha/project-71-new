        <p>A science fair is a competitive event, hosted by schools worldwide. The distinguishing characteristic of a science fair is that project entries employ the scientific method to test a hypothesis.[1] Science fairs are not exhibits or mere displays of projects. Students present their science project results in the form of a report, display board, and/or models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities.[2] The goal of a science fair is for students to answer a question based on a hypothesis. Students often work on science fair projects in addition to their school work. Therefore, most science fair entries are usually modified versions of existing experiments. Display boards help communicate the nuances of a project to science fair judges, visitors, and other entrants</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The school canteen is a great place to promote an enjoyment of healthy eating. For students who use the canteen regularly, the food purchased makes a significant contribution to their total food intake and nutrition; therefore it makes sense to ensure the best food possible is available to enhance their ability to learn and take in the information presented to them in class.For students who don’t use the canteen regularly, the canteen still plays an important educational and modelling role for healthy eating habits.There are many aspects of a child’s life that may be restricted in an educational setting. For example: the type of reading material accessed in the library, internet access and visual material (DVD) and the clothes they wear. It is appropriate to restrict unhealthy food in an educational setting. The canteen also plays an important role within the broader school environment – that of reinforcing knowledge, skills and behaviours about healthy eating and lifestyle which are taught in the classroom. Food provided at school has a considerable influence on the development of children’s long-term eating habits, food preferences and attitudes towards food. The school canteen plays a vital role in promoting healthy foods and creating a school culture of healthy eating.Food preferences are developed in childhood. By promoting and encouraging healthier food choices during childhood, it is anticipated that healthy eating habits will be carried through to adulthood and may go some way to help prevent chronic disease later in life. The focus of the NHSC project is to encourage the development and reinforcement of healthy eating patterns at school, promoting a balanced healthy eating pattern rather than focusing on weight management.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">“Data” is the lifeline of every educational institution.Right from the student turnover rate to the financial records, every piece of data that is/was ever associated with the college paves way for its development. The bigger the institution, the greater the volume of institutional data, which makes it challenging to manage on paper or even with excel files.Government Compliance & Accreditation bodies (NAAC/NBA), encourage the management of highly accurate data, in structured & easily accessible formats. It empowers transparency across activities & processes.Most of the higher education & K12 institutions are looking for an optimum distribution of resources and services to yield maximum benefits to students, teachers, and the management alike. In this world of ballooning educational demands, the right Management Information System (MIS System) can help institutions to propel their progress in the right direction.The term “MIS” itself is self-explanatory.A Management Information System or MIS is a central data repository capable of not only gathering, organizing, and storing student data but also processing and analyzing it and generating various reports from it. This is MIS in a broader sense.Education Management Information System (EMIS) is a system that monitors the performance of education programs offered by the institute and manages the distribution and allocation of educational resources. It manages, plans, and strategize to implement work processes to execute education system smoothly. Of course, in the field of education, education MIS has specific roles to help an educational institution grow.Nowadays many higher education institutions are looking forward to implementing comprehensive education management solutions to align academic processes and deliver a better student experience.</p>
